Unit tests
----------

Running "make" in this subdirectory will ensure that ipdecap
is still able to decapsulate some known encapsulated .cap files.

It will read .cap file, generate a decapsulated .cap.output file, 
and check if its md5 checksum corresponds to the one previously computed (in the .md5 files).

For esp .cap files, a .cap.conf file contains parameters needed to decrypt the payload.

I will gladly add any contributed pcap file here.
